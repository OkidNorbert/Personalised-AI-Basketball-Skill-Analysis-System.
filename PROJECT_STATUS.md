## 🎯 Your Next Steps (In Order)

### STEP 1: Setup Environment (30 minutes)

```bash
cd /home/student/Documents/Final-Year-Project/Basketball-AI-System

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test installation
python -c "import torch, mediapipe, cv2; print('✅ Ready to go!')"
```

### STEP 2: Record Your Dataset (1-2 weeks)

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART!**

Your AI model needs **real data** from **real basketball players**.

**What to record:**
- 700-1000 video clips total
- 5-10 seconds each
- Different players, different moves
- Good lighting, clear view
- Use phone camera (1080p, 30 FPS)

**Recording locations:**
- UCU basketball court
- Local sports centers
- School playgrounds
- Outdoor courts (good weather)

**How to organize:**
```bash
# After recording, transfer videos to:
1_dataset/raw_videos/shooting/    → shooting_001.mp4, shooting_002.mp4, ...
1_dataset/raw_videos/dribbling/   → dribbling_001.mp4, ...
1_dataset/raw_videos/passing/     → passing_001.mp4, ...
1_dataset/raw_videos/defense/     → defense_001.mp4, ...
1_dataset/raw_videos/idle/        → idle_001.mp4, ...
```

**Create metadata.csv:**
```csv
filename,action,player_id,date,location,quality
shooting_001.mp4,shooting,player1,2025-01-20,ucu_court,good
shooting_002.mp4,shooting,player2,2025-01-20,ucu_court,good
dribbling_001.mp4,dribbling,player1,2025-01-20,ucu_court,good
```

### STEP 3: Extract Pose Keypoints (1 day)

```bash
source venv/bin/activate

# Extract keypoints from all videos
python 2_pose_extraction/extract_keypoints.py \
    --input-dir 1_dataset/raw_videos \
    --output-dir 1_dataset/keypoints \
    --visualize
```

This creates `.npz` files containing 33 body keypoints per frame.

### STEP 4-8: Coming Next

I will create the remaining scripts for you:
- **Data preprocessing** (normalize, split train/val/test)
- **LSTM model training** (PyTorch implementation)
- **Model evaluation** (confusion matrix, metrics)
- **Performance metrics** (jump height, speed, form analysis)
- **Streamlit dashboard** (upload video → see results)

---

## 📊 What You'll Build

### Final System Features:

1. **Video Upload**
   - User uploads basketball video (5-10 sec)
   - System processes automatically

2. **AI Action Classification**
   - Detects: Shooting, Dribbling, Passing, Defense, or Idle
   - Shows confidence score

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Jump height (meters)
   - Movement speed (m/s)
   - Shot form score (0-1)
   - Reaction time (seconds)

4. **AI Recommendations**
   - "Your elbow angle is too wide (110°). Aim for 90° for better accuracy."
   - "Great jump height (0.72m)! Work on landing stability."
   - "Shot consistency: 0.65. Practice form shooting drills."

5. **Progress Tracking**
   - Charts showing improvement over time
   - Compare with previous sessions

## 💡 Key Success Factors

### 1. Quality Dataset ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (MOST IMPORTANT!)
- More videos = Better model
- Diverse players = More robust
- Good lighting = Better pose detection
- Clear movements = Easier classification

### 2. Proper Labeling
- Organize videos by action type
- Create accurate metadata.csv
- Remove bad quality videos

### 3. Realistic Expectations
- 80% accuracy is excellent for this project
- Some actions harder to classify (defense vs. idle)
- Model will improve with more data

### 4. Focus on AI/ML
- Spend 70% time on dataset + model
- Keep dashboard simple (Streamlit is perfect)
- Document your process

## 📧 Questions?

**Common Questions:**

**Q: Do I need to record all 700 videos myself?**  
A: No! Get help from:
- UCU basketball team members
- Friends who play basketball
- Local sports clubs
- You just need to organize and label them

**Q: What if I can't get 700 videos?**  
A: Minimum viable: 400-500 videos (80+ per class)
Still good results with proper quality

**Q: Can I use existing datasets?**  
A: Your lecturer wants you to create your own dataset for Uganda/Africa context. This makes your project unique!

**Q: How long does pose extraction take?**  
A: About 1-2 seconds per video on GPU, 5-10 seconds on CPU

**Q: Do I need programming skills?**  
A: Basic Python is enough. I've provided all the complex code. You just need to:
- Record videos
- Organize files
- Run the scripts I provide
- Understand what they do
